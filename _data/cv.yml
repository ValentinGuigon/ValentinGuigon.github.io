# The main file for modifying the cv is assets/json/resume.json. It is a known standard for creating cv content in json format.
# As for data/cv.yml it was the original way of creating the content for the cv page, and it is currently used as a fallback if the file assets/json/resume.json is not found.
# Since it was already implemented and is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.
