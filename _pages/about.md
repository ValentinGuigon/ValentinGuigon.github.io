##### Current position

Dr. Valentin Guigon is a postdoctoral researcher in psychology and neuroscience at the University of Maryland, working in Caroline Charpentier’s Social Learning and Decisions Lab (SLD Lab). He is also an affiliated member of the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland (AIM). His research combines behavioral experimentation, computational modeling, and neuroimaging to investigate how people learn, update beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty, particularly in social contexts.

He designs and fits interpretable models of behavior and brain function using Bayesian frameworks, reinforcement learning, heuristics, and mixtures of models. His work spans end-to-end pipelines - from experimental design and data acquisition to model implementation and interpretation - with a strong emphasis on reproducibility and methodological transparency.

His current projects are increasingly connected to NeuroAI, where he explores how cognitive models and AI systems can inform one another. He also experiments with modular multi-agent systems to support behavioral science workflows, including simulation environments, metadata parsing, and automated documentation.

##### About me

I was trained in psychology and neuroscience at Aix-Marseille Université and completed a master’s in cognitive science at Université Lumière Lyon 2. I earned my Ph.D. in neuroscience at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, under the supervision of Jean-Claude Dreher and Marie Claire Villeval. My doctoral work focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the transmission of uncertain information in social and economic environments.

Over the years, I’ve adopted a multidisciplinary approach to decision-making—bridging behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and brain imaging to understand belief formation, preference learning, and social inference. I’ve worked on questions ranging from reward learning and moral decision-making to volatility tracking, belief asymmetries, and networked cognition.

In my current work, I supervise research projects on social learning, with a focus on trust in dynamic uncertain environments, and contribute to lab-wide infrastructure for data stewardship, modeling workflows, and reproducible pipelines. I’m also interested in the development of AI tools that support scientific reasoning and help structure the production of knowledge.

##### Applied Directions and Broader Interests

• I contribute to discussions on information, polarization, critical thinking and belief calibration through public-facing pieces grounded in research.
• I have designed behavioral interventions and incentive-based nudges in applied contexts
• I participate in public education efforts, including invited instruction at the 2025 CORTECS summer school on critical reasoning and scientific thinking
• I develop AI systems that support scientific work and reproducibility.

Beyond research, I maintain a strong interest in the role of cognitive science in public policy making, as well as photography, climbing, cinema, music, literature, epistemology...
