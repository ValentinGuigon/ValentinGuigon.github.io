### Current position

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Maryland, working in Caroline Charpentier’s Social Learning and Decisions Lab ([SLD Lab](https://sldlab.umd.edu/)). I am also an affiliated member of the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland ([AIM](https://aim.umd.edu/)) and an affiliate researcher of the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science ([NACS](https://nacs.umd.edu/)) program.

I currently supervise computational psychiatry projects on social learning, with a particular focus on trust in dynamic and uncertain social environments.

### About me

My research combines behavioral experimentation, computational modeling, and neuroimaging to study how people learn, update beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty - especially in social contexts. I'm broadly interested in how people calibrate confidence, assess risk, and learn how to trust, and in how these capacities relate to the norms and institutions that structure social life. More recently, I've been drawn to foundational questions about the nature of cognition and the relationship between neuroscience and AI.

I was trained in psychology and neuroscience at Aix-Marseille Université and completed a Master’s degree in Cognitive Science at Université Lumière Lyon 2. I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, under the supervision of Jean-Claude Dreher and Marie Claire Villeval. My doctoral research focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the transmission of uncertain information in social contexts.

I write about cognition, AI, and epistemology on Substack. Outside of research, I boulder, and I spend a lot of time thinking about the works of Gregory Crewdson, Saul Leiter, David Lynch, Walt Whitman, and about The birth of Tragedy.
