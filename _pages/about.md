Postdoctoral researcher in Cognitive Neurosciences

Valentin joined the faculty at the University of Maryland in March 2024 as a Postdoctoral Researcher. He obtained his PhD under the supervision of Jean-Claude Dreher and Prof. Marie Claire Villeval at Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (Lyon, France). 

His doctoral thesis focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in the transmission of uncertain information among humans. Valentin has adopted a multidisciplinary approach to explore the multifaceted aspects of human decision-making, from its behavior to its biological foundations via its computational processes. He gradually contributed to the research on impulsive actions, reward anticipation and processing, moral decision-making, beliefs about fake news, information-seeking behaviors, beliefs about others' preferences for information and beliefs in large-scale social networks.  

Beside his scientific interests, Valentin likes to pile arts and activities on the balance. Ask him about photography, climbing, cinema or literature.
