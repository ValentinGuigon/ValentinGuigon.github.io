##### Current position

Dr. Guigon is currently Postdoctoral Researcher in Psychology and Neurosciences. He recently joined Dr. Caroline Charpentier Social Learning and Decisions Lab, at the University of Maryland. His current research projects combine behavioral experimentation, computational modeling and imagery of brain processes underlying social learning.

##### About me

After receiving license degrees in Psychology and Neurosciences from Aix-Marseille Université, and a Cognitive Sciences Master degree at Université Lumière Lyon 2, I pursued a Ph.D. in Neurosciences at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. My Ph.D., obtained under the supervision of Jean-Claude Dreher and Prof. Marie Claire Villeval, focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in the transmission of uncertain information among humans.

During my training, I adopted a multidisciplinary approach to explore the multifaceted aspects of human decision-making, from its group behavior to its individual biological foundations via its computational processes. From that approach I gradually contributed to the research on reward processing, moral decision-making, beliefs about information and information-seeking behaviors, beliefs about others' beliefs and beliefs in large-scale social networks. With my current postdoctoral position at Dr. Charpentier's SLD lab, my training fit a recent field of research called _computational psychiatry_.

My scientific interests extend to Epistemology, computational reproducibility and the contributions of sciences to the public policy making. I also like to pile arts and activities on the balance; feel free to share with me your thoughts on photography, climbing, cinema, literature or the latest meta-modernist trend.
