##### Current position

I joined Caroline Charpentier Social Learning and Decisions Lab, at the University of Maryland, as a Postdoctoral Researcher in March 2024. My current research project combines behavioral tasks in a social learning battery, computational modeling and functional imagery of brain processes.

##### About me

I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Jean-Claude Dreher and Prof. Marie Claire Villeval at Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (Lyon, France). My doctoral thesis focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in the transmission of uncertain information among humans. I adopted a multidisciplinary approach to explore the multifaceted aspects of human decision-making, from its behavior to its biological foundations via its computational processes. From that approach I gradually contributed to the research on reward processing, moral decision-making, beliefs about information and information-seeking behaviors, beliefs about others' and beliefs in large-scale social networks. My scientific interests extend to Epistemology, computational reproducibility and the contributions of sciences to the public policy making.

Besides my scientific interests, I like to pile arts and activities on the balance. Feel free to share with me your thoughts on photography, climbing, cinema, literature or the latest meta-modernist trend.
