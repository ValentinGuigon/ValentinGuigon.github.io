### Current position

Dr. Valentin Guigon is a postdoctoral researcher in Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Maryland, working in Caroline Charpentier’s Social Learning and Decisions Lab ([SLD Lab](https://sldlab.umd.edu/)). He is also an affiliated member of the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland ([AIM](https://aim.umd.edu/)) and an affiliate researcher of the Neuroscience and Cognitive Science ([NACS](https://nacs.umd.edu/)) program.

His research combines behavioral experimentation, computational modeling, and neuroimaging to investigate how people learn, update beliefs, and make decisions under uncertainty, with a particular focus on social contexts. He designs experimental paradigms and develops interpretable models of behavior and brain function using Bayesian frameworks, reinforcement learning, heuristic models, and model mixtures. His work spans experimental design, data acquisition, model implementation, and interpretation, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility, methodological transparency, and robust inference.

In parallel, he develops methodological and computational infrastructure to support behavioral and cognitive neuroscience research. This includes the design of reproducible experimental and modeling workflows, as well as the exploration of modular multi-agent systems for scientific applications such as simulation environments, metadata parsing, and automated documentation. A central aim of this work is to clarify how computational cognitive models and modern AI systems can inform one another.

### About me

I was trained in psychology and neuroscience at Aix-Marseille Université and completed a Master’s degree in Cognitive Science at Université Lumière Lyon 2. I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, under the supervision of Jean-Claude Dreher and Marie Claire Villeval. My doctoral research focused on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the transmission of uncertain information in social and economic environments.

My work adopts a multidisciplinary approach to decision-making, integrating behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and brain imaging to study belief formation, preference learning, and social inference. I have addressed questions ranging from reward learning and moral decision-making to belief updating about others, trust dynamics, and networked cognition.

In my current work, I supervise computational neuroscience projects on social learning, with a particular focus on trust in dynamic and uncertain environments. These projects combine computational modeling, fMRI, and behavioral game-theoretic approaches. I also coordinate aspects of lab operations and research process automation, and supervise undergraduate researchers involved in these projects.

Beyond individual projects, I contribute to lab-wide efforts in data stewardship, modeling workflows, and reproducible research pipelines. I am also interested in the development of AI-based tools that support scientific reasoning and help structure the production of knowledge, and I actively engage with emerging methods such as Bayesian inference, Deep learning, Large language models, and AI agents as part of an ongoing commitment to continuous learning.

Beyond research, I maintain a strong interest in the role of cognitive science in public policy making, as well as photography, climbing, cinema, music, literature, and epistemology.
